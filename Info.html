<p>Amanita muscaria</p>
<p>Amanita muscaria or the Fly Agaric is a mushroom commonly  found in deciduous forests in and around Melbourne and other parts of  Australia. This mushroom is usually thought of as being a psychedelic mushroom,  often associated with Alice in Wonderland or similar. Amanita muscaria,  actually does not have any psychedelic compounds in it. Although this mushroom  can induce hallucinations, the compounds in it that produce said hallucinations  are ibotenic acid and muscimol, which are not psychedelic compounds. Users say  that the feeling you get from ingesting these mushrooms feels similar to being  drunk.</p>

<p>Leratiomyces ceres</p>
<p>Leratiomyces meres or Redlead Roundheads are a mulch loving mushroom and can be found anywhere from your backyard to deep in the forest. They like to grow in woodchips, bark, or any type of tree debris. They are extremely common so you have most likely seen this mushroom if you have been looking. They are poisonous but eating them will not kill you. You may feel sick for a while though. These mushrooms often grow around the psychedelic Psilocybe Subaeruginosa.</p>

<p>Gallerina marginata</p>
<p>Gallerina marginata or the Skullcap is a wood loving mushroom that grows on decaying wood or mulch. The Skullcap is fairly hard to find in Victoria which is a good thing because it is extremely poisonous. This mushroom contains the same deadly toxic compounds as that of the Deathcap mushroom. If ingested, it is known to cause severe liver damage, vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia and eventually death. There has only been about ten poisonings attributed to this mushroom over the last century. This mushroom looks very similar to other edible species of mushroom such as the psychedelic Psilocybe Subaeruginosa.</p>

<p>Geastrum saccatum</p>
<p>Geastrum saccatum, or the Rounded Earthstar is a mushroom with a worldwide distribution. It is usually found growing on rotting wood and leaf litter, found often in the late summer and autumn. It is a fairly common mushroom. In Brazil, its name translates to “star of the land” due to its unfurling out layer. The inside layer is kind of like a sack that is filed with spores. Whenever the sack is agitated, spores are shot out of a hole in the top. These mushrooms are considered inedible.</p>

<p>Psilocybe subaeruginosa</p>
<p>Psilocybe subaeruginosa or Subs for short are mushrooms commonly found on mulch, dead leaves and tree debris. They love rain and grow in abundance during the middle of winter. Subs hold the psychedelic compounds psilocyn and psilocybin. These compounds affect the brains prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that regulates, thinking and thought analysis. This part of the brain also plays a key role in mood and perception. Psilocybin mushrooms can also make you hallucinate. These mushrooms are fairly common and often found in patches in certain areas. They are very similar in appearance to the Skullcap. It is strongly recommended not to eat any wild mushrooms that you may find.</p>
